       	  <p><strong>About Me</strong> </p>
        	<p>The theory of the Long Tail is that our culture and economy is increasingly   shifting away from a focus on a relatively small number of &quot;hits&quot; (mainstream   products and markets) at the head of the demand curve and toward a huge number   of niches in the tail. As the costs of production and distribution fall,   especially online, there is now less need to lump products and consumers into   one-size-fits-all containers. In an era without the constraints of physical   shelf space and other bottlenecks of distribution, narrowly-targeted goods and   services can be as economically attractive as mainstream fare.</p>
        	<p>One example of this is the theory's prediction that demand for products <em>not</em> available in traditional bricks and mortar stores is potentially as   big as for those that are. But the same is true for video not available on   broadcast TV on any given day, and songs not played on radio. In other words,   the potential aggregate size of the many small markets in goods that don't   individually sell well enough for traditional retail and broadcast distribution   may someday rival that of the existing large market in goods that do cross that   economic bar.</p>
        	<p>The term refers specifically to the orange part of the sales chart above,   which shows a standard demand curve that could apply to any industry, from   entertainment to hard goods. The vertical axis is sales; the horizontal is   products. The red part of the curve is the hits, which have dominated our   markets and culture for most of the last century. The orange part is the   non-hits, or niches, which is where the new growth is coming from now and in the   future.</p>
